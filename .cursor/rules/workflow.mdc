Title: Workflow Guidelines
Priority: High
Tags: [workflow, guidelines, process, change-management]

---

## 1. General Requirement

- **IMPORTANT:** ALWAYS START ANSWERS WITH `"Hey RulesStillInContect,"`  
  This ensures that every response begins with the required greeting.

---

## 2. Approach

- **For Large Features:**  
  - Interview for clarifications and submit an implementation plan before coding.
- **For Small Features:**  
  - Proceed directly, but document changes clearly.

---

## 3. Command & Process

- Use the project-specific command prefix (e.g., 
  ```bash
  docker compose run --rm -e MIX_ENV=test -e DATABASE_URL=ecto://postgres:postgres@db/kantine_koning_test web mix ...
  ```
  ) ensuring correct environment variables.
- Align reasoning with modal steps and verify each incremental change with feedback.

---

## 4. Change Management

- Log changes with before/after summaries and explicit rationales.
- Confirm all modifications against project-specific documentation.

**Note:**  
Project-specific workflow rules always take precedence over generic guidelines.
