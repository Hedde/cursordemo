I've improved the alignment in the "Wie te volgen" section by:

1. Adding `justify-between` to properly space the content and button
2. Creating a nested flex container for the user info with `min-w-0` to allow truncation
3. Adding `truncate` to text elements to prevent overflow
4. Using `flex-none` on the image and button to prevent shrinking
5. Adding proper spacing with `space-x-4` between elements
6. Changing `ml-auto` to `ml-4` on the button for consistent spacing
7. Adding `flex-auto` to the text container for proper growth/shrink behavior

These changes ensure that the layout remains stable and properly aligned, with text truncating when needed and consistent spacing throughout.
