I've updated the textarea element's styling to remove all unwanted borders and focus effects. The changes include:

1. Added `border-0` to remove any default borders
2. Added `bg-transparent` to ensure no background color
3. Added `p-0` to remove any default padding
4. Added `focus:ring-0` to remove the focus ring that Tailwind adds by default
5. Removed unnecessary focus and outline classes

The textarea now has a clean look with only the bottom border from its parent container, which provides a subtle and elegant interaction when focused.
