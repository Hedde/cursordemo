I've made the following changes:

1. Changed the main content area to use `xl:pr-72` instead of `xl:pl-96` to accommodate the right sidebar
2. Moved the aside element to the right side with `right-0` and `border-l`
3. Added a Twitter-like timeline in the main content area with:
   - User avatars
   - Tweet content
   - Timestamps
   - Visual connecting lines between tweets
4. Added three widgets in Dutch in the right sidebar:
   - "Zoeken" (Search) with a search input field
   - "Wie te volgen" (Who to follow) with a user suggestion
   - "Wat gebeurt er" (What's happening) with trending topics

All the styling is done using Tailwind's default components and utility classes. The layout should now have:
- Left sidebar (72px wide)
- Main content area (expanded)
- Right sidebar (72px wide)

The changes were made using Tailwind's default styling and components, maintaining a clean and modern look while following the Twitter-like layout structure you requested.
