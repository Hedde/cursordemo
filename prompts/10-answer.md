# Component Separation Plan and Implementation

I've helped break down the UI into modular components and implemented them with a focus on separation of concerns. Here's what was done:

## 1. Component Structure Created
Created a logical directory structure:
```
lib/cursor_demo_web/
  ├── components/
  │   ├── layouts/
  │   ├── navigation/
  │   ├── timeline/
  │   └── sidebar/
```

## 2. Navigation Components
Created three navigation components:
- `MobileMenuComponent`: Off-canvas mobile menu
- `DesktopSidebarComponent`: Desktop sidebar navigation
- `MobileTopNavComponent`: Mobile top navigation bar

## 3. Timeline Components
Created timeline-related components:
- `PostFormComponent`: Form for creating new posts
- `PostComponent`: Individual post display with actions
- `TimelineComponent`: Container for posts and post form

## 4. Sidebar Components
Created right sidebar components:
- `SearchComponent`: Search functionality
- `WhoToFollowComponent`: User suggestions
- `TrendingComponent`: Trending topics

## 5. Main Live View Update
Updated `LandingLive` to:
- Use all new components
- Initialize necessary assigns
- Prepare for PubSub implementation

## Next Steps
1. Implement PubSub functionality for each component
2. Add backend interactions for:
   - Post creation/interaction
   - User following
   - Search functionality
   - Real-time updates

Each component is now ready for PubSub implementation, with placeholder event handlers in place.
