# Analysis of ICTU GitHub Policy Compliance

## Current Status
Based on the analysis of the project structure and the ICTU GitHub policy requirements, here's the current status:

### Present Files (✓)
- README.md (Contains good documentation about installation, development setup, and common tasks)
- .gitignore
- Docker configuration files
- Project-specific files (mix.exs, etc.)

### Missing Required Files (❌)
1. LICENSE
2. CONTRIBUTING.md
3. CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
4. SECURITY.md

## Action Plan
1. Create LICENSE file using Apache License 2.0 (common for ICTU projects)
2. Create CONTRIBUTING.md with contribution guidelines
3. Create CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md following ICTU standards
4. Create SECURITY.md with security policy and reporting guidelines
5. Review and update README.md if needed to ensure it meets all ICTU requirements

## Next Steps
We will proceed by creating each missing file one by one, ensuring they comply with ICTU standards and best practices. Would you like me to start creating these files in a specific order, or should I proceed with the order mentioned above?
