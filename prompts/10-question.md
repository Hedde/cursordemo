@app.html.heex @root.html.heex create a plan to make each UI section a component so we can separate concerns in a logical robust manner. Each section in the UI has its own purpose, I want the frontend to be fully driven by pubsub so ideally there's little to no interaction with the backend unless a user action takes place or a broadcast is received in a component that is subscribed to it. Make a plan to first separate the components without any actual server functionality, just the html/heex. After that is nicely separated we will continue on implementing the nesecarry server side per component, one at a time.
